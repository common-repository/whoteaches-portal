WhoTeaches Portal enables embedding of any WhoTeaches profile and Package/s on any page or post in your WordPress site.

== Description ==

<p>The WhoTeaches Portal WordPress Plugin lets you embed any WhoTeaches profile anywhere on your WordPress website.<br>
This plugin, just like our service, is free to use.</p>

<p>There are two main options for use with the plugin:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Profile Embed - Embed an entire profile with the shortcode [WhoTeaches_Portal slug="profile-slug"]</li>
	<li>Package Embed - Embed any WhoTeaches Package or a collection of Packages with the shortcode [WhoTeaches_Portal packages="package-slug,another-package-slug"]</li>
</ol>

<h3>General instructions</h3>
<p>The WhoTeaches Portal plugin utilizes the easy-to-use WordPress shortcode. Here is how it works:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Install the plugin</li>
	<li>Create a new page or post or edit an existing one</li>
</ul>

<h3>Profile Embed</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Paste this code anywhere in the body of your page/post: <strong>[WhoTeaches_Portal slug="profile-slug"]</strong></li>
	<li>replace "profile-slug" with a <strong>valid profile slug</strong> that you will find on https://whoteaches.com in the URL of any profile. The profile slug is the username which appears right after "whoteaches.com/users/" and ends before the next forward-slash. Take for example a profile with the URL "https://whoteaches.com/users/mary-poppins/package/fly-with-me" - the slug in the case will be "mary-poppins"</li>
	<li>Once you replaced the profile slug with a valid slug (keep the quotation marks around the slug), then update your page/post, and automagically, the profile will appear on the front end of your website.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you embed a profile, the profile information will appear at the top of the WhoTeaches Portal followed by all the Packages that appear on that profile.</p>

<h3>Package Embed</h3>
<p>You may also choose to embed single or several Packages from different tutors anywhere on your site. For instance, say you write an article about kickboxing and would like to embed a Package deal from WhoTeaches in the middle of your article to offer your readers incredible kickboxing private class deals. By pasting the shortcode and updating it with the Package/s information, you can easily achieve that. Here's how:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Just like for Profile Embed, we are going to use the WhoTeaches Portal shortcode, but with a slight difference. You can embed the code on any page, or post, anywhere in the body of your article. Want it on top - put it on top. Want it in the middle of your article? just paste it there!<br>
	Paste this shortcode into your article: <strong>[WhoTeaches_Portal packages="first_package,second_package"]</strong>.
	</li>
	<li>As you probably guessed, all you need to do is replace "first_package" and "second_package" with <strong>valid WhoTeaches Package urls</strong>. Head over to https://whoteaches.com and navigate to any Package you wish to embed.<br>
	Let's use the example we saw above: "https://whoteaches.com/users/mary-poppins/package/fly-with-me" - Copy the URL starting with the profile slug until the end of the URL, so in this case we will copy "mary-poppins/package/fly-with-me".
	</li>
	<li>Replace "first_package" with the code we copied above, and repeat for the second Package, if you wish to add another. You may add as many Packages as you'd like or embed a single one. You can use the WhoTeaches Portal shortcode as often as you see fit.</li>
	<li>Remember to leave the quotation marks around the Package code you enter into the shortcode, and separate packages with a comma. We do not add a comma after the last Package on the list and we do not use one at all if we only add a single Package.</li>
</ul>

<p>WhoTeaches Portal is the easiest way to add valuable content to your WordPress website, keep your readers engaged, offer them discounted private class Package deals, and the appealing design is adaptive and ready to fit perfectly on mobile devices.</p>
<p>In addition to adding appealing content for your readers, WhoTeaches Portal will help you attract new readers by growing your WhoTeaches referral network of followers. When you embed your profile on your website, your profile information will appear together with a direct links to your profile on WhoTeaches, and links to your Following/Followers lists.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend you use WhoTeaches Portal Profile Embed on a dedicated page on your website for clarity.</p>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there any cost to using WhoTeaches Portal? =

There is no cost, direct or indirect, for using our plugin. It's free, easy-to-use, and it looks great!

= Do I need a WhoTeaches account to use WhoTeaches Portal? =

You do not need a WhoTeaches account/profile to use WhoTeaches Portal. You can embed any profile, including one that is not yours, on your WordPress website, or any Package on any page/post. Of course, it makes much more sense to create a free account on WhoTeaches and embed your own profile with your own Packages.

Not at all. This is a simple plug-and-play deal. Just install, add the shortcode where you want it, and enjoy.
